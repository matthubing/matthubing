LucasArts produced the first games I played on my first computer in 1993, _Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe_ and _The Secret of Monkey Island_ (so many secrets?). Both came on brand new CD-ROMs and had great sound via my Soundblaster 16.

I played just about every adventure game they produced, my favorites being _Sam & Max Hit the Road_, _Grim Fandango_, and _The Curse of Monkey Island_.

Also notable was the X-Wing/Tie Fighter series. Space combat was well done.

_Dark Forces_ brought some great FPS action to the scene.
